The role of John Bentel, whose identity as a key figure in the email probes was first reported by Yahoo News on Wednesday, is expected to be one focus of questioning today when Clinton’s former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, is deposed in a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch over the State Department’s handling of Freedom of Information Act requests relating to Clinton’s emails, according to a source close to the case.</p><br clear="all"/></a></td>

U.S. scientists said the infection in a 49-year-old Pennsylvania woman &quot;heralds the emergence of truly pan-drug resistant bacteria&quot; because it could not be controlled even by colistin, an antibiotic reserved for &quot;nightmare&quot; bugs. In Japan, British Prime Minister David Cameron said leading countries needed to tackle resistance by reducing the use of antibiotics and rewarding drug companies for developing new medicines.</p><br clear="all"/></a></td>

In addition to providing users with an up-to-date guide to giving and receiving sexual consent under Title IX, the app’s new college format can be customized to reflect each school’s policies — as well as its color scheme.</p><br clear="all"/></a></td>
